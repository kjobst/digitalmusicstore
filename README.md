### Querie a Digital Music store to provide insights

1. This query looks at the top selling genre within our music store.
    * The purpose is to find potential untapped genres
  
2. This query takes inventory for the two top selling genres.
   * It breaks it down to songs per artist in that genre and total songs for the entire genre.

3. This query is beneficial for looking at genre or artist. It can be adjusted with the WHERE clause to get the information you want. 
   * With this query we can look at  artists, genre, how much the artist has made in that genre, artists total earnings and finally the total earnings for a specific genre.
 
 4. This query looks at yearly sales for genres but again the WHERE clause could be adjusted for artist.
    * This should account for any trends in purchases over the 4 years of data.
